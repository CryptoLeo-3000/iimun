/* Text With the dawn of the 21st century, it is quintessential to have practical experiences to understand and adapt better to the world we live today. We preach globalization and global citizenship, we foresee our students and children as future leaders with global perspectives, however, apart from just defining these terms, there is little that is done to imbibe these traits within them. IIMUN has reinvented educational travel and started its latest project, ‘Experiential Learning & Activities’. This program has been thoughtfully curated and targeted for young students between the age of 13 to 18. Being an overseas program, students (and faculty) are given a unique opportunity to travel to another country of their choice with our organization for this week-long experience. A pre-set itinerary is created keeping in mind not only tourist hotspots but also places of educative, historic, naturistic & artistic value. Unique activities have also been formulated for students to participate in, exposing and developing their critical-thinking abilities, leadership skills etcetera. Field visits to the top Universities of the country to give them an ‘on-campus experience’. An international I.I.M.U.N conference which will be seeing a diverse participation of students from several countries. Introducing the ‘Global Indian’, where students log their experiences and learnings throughout their journey. They are encouraged to learn from the country's culture and discover innovative and creative methods to contribute to developing India. Introducing the ‘EXPlorer’, a combination of experiences, activities and guided tours for recreational and educational purposes.
