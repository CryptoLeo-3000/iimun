/* Text Dear Faculty Member, Do you want to organise a virtual inter school event like none other in your city? Do you want to raise the profile of your institute- without spending a rupee and whilst adding revenue to the school? Do you want to have the students engage in something outside the virtual classroom- which focuses on building glocal citizens with an Indian/ inclusive mindset? After that get an option to establish an MUN club for free and receive content for 35 weeks worth activities. Teachers will then undergo free formal workshops for the same as well. And all the while have your students, yourself and the school earn a certificate from the worlds largest youth run organisation which is formally supported by Mr. Deepak Parekh, Mr. Ajay Piramal, Mr. Godrej, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Dr. Suresh Prabhu, Chiefs of Armed Forces, AR Rahman amongst others. Our alumni includes over 2000+ students who’ve studied at Ivy League/ similar schools- many becoming parliamentarians/ authors/ lawyers and now even MUN teachers. For the first time in its history, after having impacted 50 million students and popularising the concept of an Indianised/ inclusive actionable MUN from 19 schools in 2011 to now 29,000 schools- I.I.M.U.N. on the back of its 26,000 young student volunteers realises that MUN has become popular- but glocal citizenship needs to be strengthened, therefore for select institutes that echo the same mindset and want to build glocal leaders, we are here to provide MUN 360! For Free! As an organisation that has put together concourses in the UN Headquarters, hosted Heads of Nations, Nobel laureates, UN Secretary Generals, Hollywood and Bollywood Luminaries alike, we realise we are in a unique position to make a difference to a school who has an existing program or is wanting to set up one. With our network of 7500 schools stretching from Montevideo to Mumbai & from Tokyo to Trichy, all agendas and study material are carefully vetted by our Academic Advisory Council. With over 10,000+ committee choices and agendas ranging from ‘Reforming the UN’ to ‘Study Arthashastra and solve the Israel Palestine dispute’, students are exposed in a 2 day event with an inaugural ceremony- followed by debate sessions- the next day begins with a yoga/ meditation session- followed by debate before awards being given in the closing ceremony. After this they are expected to plant a tree/ plant, only then getting a certificate. Thereafter an I.I.M.U.N. club is set up and so also a free teacher training program to ensure the continuity of the club. The only financial implication is that I.I.M.U.N. is that we will charge a percentage of the conference fee as our fee. The requirement from the school is a willing student in charge and/ or a teacher in charge who will oversee activities.. For further details, please contact Mr. Abhishek Dhawan abhishekdhawan.iimun@gmail.com
