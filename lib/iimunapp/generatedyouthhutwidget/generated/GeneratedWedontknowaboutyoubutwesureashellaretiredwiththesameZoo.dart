/* Text We don’t know about you but we sure as hell are tired with the same Zoom classes and the same MUN-dane extracurriculars. As what is recognised as the worlds largest youth run organisation, we have come up with some a revolutionary concept which also involves a give away of INR 100.00 worth prizes! Think of An open mic featuring Spoken word- poetry- stand up-songs, a Bollywood Stock Exchange, Indian Parliamentary Debates, Quiz contests and a ‘Build your start up now’ centre. A 2 day educational extravaganza which helps you develop skills from public speaking to number crunching and from entrepreneurship to showcasing your hidden talents. Additionally- do well and get a chance to perform for an audience of 10,000+ or get guidance and seed funding for your idea. Check the document for the rules of the competition. Festivals are often associated for college students, but we feel it’s time to bring them to school. After all when the country is the worlds largest youth democracy, it is only right that India’s International Movement to Unite Nations trains tomorrow’s leaders, today. True to the style of I.I.M.U.N. expect celebrity judges, guest speakers and some breathtaking surprises as I.I.M.U.N launches its first YouthHUT, an edutainment soirée! So what you waiting for- Let’s play! For further details, please contact Mr. Prashant Nagpal prashant.nagpal@iimun.in or +91 9819047544
